# Capstone Portfolio

## Capabilities statement

My name is Jade, I am a student finishing up my degree with a capstone project as well as working fulltime as a security engineer. I have used my experience in consulting and security to guide the project towards developing a meaningful project.
During the project I took on the role as team leader ensuring all students had the help they needed as well as the information necessary to finish their tasks.

###### Skills:
- Leadership
- Project Management
- Security assessments
- Enterprise Security Knowledge

## Project Introduction

The aim of the project is to deliver a self-assessment of the NIST framework that will be used by Australian business. The question set will be tested and validated with real world scenarios to ensure questions are easily consumable. The NIST framework will have a heavy consulting aspect once an assessment is completed, this will be completed by Deakin students in the cybersecurity degree with the help of an industry professional.

My role in the project was team leader. In this role I was responsible for project direction, task allocation, and management duties. The role functioned very similar to what a project manager would do in an enterprise.

The project went through 2 large changes over the 2 capstone units. The first change was to define what the project was delivering and the outcomes we were delivering to. We had a question set but decided it did not meet the project needs or requirements we set out. We then developed a much more useful NIST assessment method based on a maturity model.

###### Project Contribution
My role as team leader focused on establishing the project outcomes, and ensuring we all had tasks, knew what to do, and make decisions about project direction.

When the project started there was no solution documents or project outcomes that would enable the project to measure success. The first deliverables I made were the Solution On A Page (SOAP) as well as the High Level Solution Design (HLSD).

The project was also tracking progress and tasks though a messy excel spreadsheet, I also moved tasks to Planner a teamâ€™s module for task allocation. This allowed for a more interactive experience as well as buckets so we could run the project with sprints easily.

By using planner we were able to achieve all tasks for each sprint due to being able to easily monitor and track progress. 

During the project we have not had a sponsor or client. So far, the only feedback we have gotten is from the supervisor and the head of cyber a Deakin who we presented the project to. The meeting confirmed we were on the right track and gave pointers on what we could do better to improve the questions. One of the suggestions was testing the NIST model on many different departments at Deakin.
